# Basic OpenAL Binding

## OpenAL.NET

This library includes very basic playback and capture support for OpenAL.

Support for audio capture and playback is provided using the .NET Stream API and fully supports the Begin/End and Async patterns.

### Positional Audio

You can enable positional audio by following the example in the included [EchoApp](https://github.com/JohnACarruthers/OpenAL.NET/blob/master/EchoApp/Program.cs).
